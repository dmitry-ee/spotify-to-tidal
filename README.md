just export
```

### Clean Tidal library
Performance: ~100 tracks/minute

just tidal-clean
```
And then
```bash
just tidal-clean-confirm
```

### Find exact matches between exported Spotify Library and Tidal
Performance: ~80 tracks/minute
Coverage: 90%
```bash
just tidal-first-processing
```

### Then find lazy matches (lookup only by track name then make match by album)
Performance: ~80 tracks/minute
Coverage: 5%
```bash
just tidal-first-processing
```

### Process the rest manually
**NOTE:** That really could take some time
```bash
just tidal-manual-processing
```

And then just like them in Tidal app otherwise skip it
```bash
just tidal-show-non-founds
```

### Import
Performance: ~90 tracks/minute
```bash
just tidal-import-library
```
And then
```bash
just tidal-import-library-confirm
```
